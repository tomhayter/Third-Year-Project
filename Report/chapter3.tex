\section{Requirements}

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

Functional requirements for the system:

\begin{itemize}
\item The system needs to be able to store all dishes from the menu of a restaurant, along with the ingredients that make up that dish.
\item The system should be able to produce a list of these dishes to the customer.
\item The owner of a restaurant should be able to add ingredients and dishes to the system.
\item A customer needs to be able to query the system for dishes they desire.
\item Therefore, the system should filter the dishes by various dietry requirements, such as diets, allergies and filter by calories.
\item The system should have the option to hide calorie information to those who do not want to see it.
\end{itemize}

Possible additions to the system:

\begin{itemize}
\item The system could filter dishes by how a meal has been prepared and cooked.
\item The system could calculate new information for a dish based on whether a customer would like to add or remove an ingredient.
\item The system could allow for a restaurant owner to register new allergens and diets to filter by.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Non-Functional Requirements}

The non-functional requirements of the project are that it must:

\begin{itemize}
\item The system must be intuitive, easy to use, and provide appropriate feedback when changes are made to the system.
\item The interface must conform to Ben Shneiderman's 8 golden rules~\cite{shneiderman}.
\item A restaurant owner should require minimal training to use the system.
\item A customer should need no training to use the system.
\item The system should allow customers to search for dishes as fast as possible. This is important as the restaurant and the customer will want the customer to make a decision quickly on what dish they would like to order.
\end{itemize}

\section{Evaluation Plan}

To test the ontology system, I plan to conduct user studies, where I will ask people that I know to carry out certain tasks using the system, such as adding or removing a dish from the system, and searching for dishes with certain parameters. These tasks will cover each aspect of the functional requirements of the system to completely evaluate how successfully the system meets the criteria.

It is important that the participants of the study are comfortable and give an honest review of the system. To do this, I aim to avoid putting them under any pressures. I will not place them under any time constraints to complete the tasks, and make sure that when I propose the study to them that the estimation is accurate, while also a slight overestimate. It is also important that the participant doesn't feel any pressure to falsely support the system, when it is in fact failing.

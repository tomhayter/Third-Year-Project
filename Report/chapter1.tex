\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Overview}

My project explores how ontologies can be used to store information about a restaurant's menu. 
I will also explore what extent it is possible to store information, for example whether you can store calorific information about ingredients, calculate dishes suitable for certain diets and calculate new information about a dish with certain ingredients removed or extra ingredients added.

The final product will consist of two user interfaces. The first will allow a customer to view and filter the menu. The second will allow the owner of a restaurant to create and edit the menu.

\section{Technologies}

Ontologies are stored in a \textit{.owl} file, which is similar to an XML. I initially used Protege to get used to working with ontologies, as it is a good environment for working with them. The user interfaces are written in Java as it has the useful and comprehensive OWL API\cite{owl_api}. I useed Java Swing to create the user interfaces themselves. The project is built using Maven and produces a runnable .jar file that should be placed in the same folder as the .owl file.

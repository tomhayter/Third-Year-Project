\section{Requirements}

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

These are the requirements of the ontology:

\begin{itemize}
\item Each dish, split into the components and ingredients that the dish contains.
\item Allergen information for each dish.
\item Meals that are suitable for various diets e.g. Vegetarian dishes.
\item Types of customer e.g. Vegans and those with Coelaic disease.
\item Calorific content of each meal.
\end{itemize}

These are possible additions that could be made to the ontology, but are not necessary for the MVP:

\begin{itemize}
\item The ability to query a dish with ingredients added or removed.
\item The ability to query a dish based on how a dish has been cooked, e.g. Which meals have not used a deep fryer to be made?
\end{itemize}

The requirements of the user interface for restaurant owner:

\begin{itemize}
\item Add and remove meals using ingredients and components list.
\item Add and remove ingredients and components, in same page as above and separate.
\item Add and remove customer types (dietry requirements and allergens).
\item Query the ontology.
\item A settings menu to have the option to hide calory information.
\end{itemize}

Some additional possible bonuses to the user interface are:

\begin{itemize}
\item A view for each dish, where the restaurant owner can edit the dish.
\item The ability to add and remove dietary requirements as new ones become available.
\end{itemize}

Dietary Requirements to filter by:

\begin{itemize}
\item Vegetarian
\item Vegan
\item Pescetarian
\item Religious diets e.g. Halal / Kosher preparation, Hindu and Sikh.
\end{itemize}

Allergies\cite{burks2001food}:

\begin{itemize}
\item Peanut
\item Ceoliac (gluten)
\item Wheat
\item Cow's milk
\item Eggs
\item Fish
\item Shellfish
\item Tree nuts
\item Soybeans
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Non-Functional Requirements}

The non-functional requirements of the project are that it must:

\begin{itemize}
\item The UI must be intuitive, easy to use, and provide appropriate feedback when changes are made to the ontology.
\item There must not be any redundant parts of the ontology, as the aim is to reduce the size of the memory
\end{itemize}

\section{Evaluation Plan}

To test the ontology system, I plan to conduct user studies, where I will ask people that I know to carry out certain tasks using the system, such as adding or removing a dish from the system, and searching for meals with certain parameters. These tasks will cover each aspect of the functional requirements of the system to completely evaluate how successfully the system meets the criteria.

It is important that the participants of the study are comfortable and give an honest review of the system. To do this, I aim to avoid putting them under any pressures. I will not place them under any time constraints to complete the tasks, and make sure that when I propose the study to them that the estimation is accurate, while also a slight overestimate. It is also important that the participant doesn't feel any pressure to falsely support the system, when it is in fact failing.

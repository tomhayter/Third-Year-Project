\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Overview}

My project explores how ontologies can be used to store information about a restaurant's menu. 
I will also explore what extent it is possible to store information, for example whether you can store calorific information about ingredients, calculate dishes suitable for certain diets and calculate new information about a dish with certain ingredients removed or extra ingredients added.

The final product will consist of two user interfaces. The first will allow a customer to view and filter the menu. The second will allow the owner of a restaurant to create and edit the menu.

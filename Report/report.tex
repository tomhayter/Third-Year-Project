I used this \cite{pizza_tutorial_pdf}.

\section{Requirements of the ontology}

These are the requirements of the ontology so that it can store all the information that I would like it to:

\begin{itemize}
\item Ingredient list for every meal on a menu, split into the components of the dish.
\item Calorific content of each meal.
\item Allergen information for each meal.
\item Types of customer e.g. Vegetarians and those with Coelaic disease.
\end{itemize}

These are possible additions that could be made to the ontology, but are not necessary for the MVP:

\begin{itemize}
\item The ability to query a dish with ingredients added or removed.
\item The ability to query a dish based on how a dish has been cooked, e.g. Which meals have not used a deep fryer to be made?
\end{itemize}

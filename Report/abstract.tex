The aim of this report is to explore ontologies and their ability to store information. This report explores ontologies in the context of the menu of a restaurant, and how it is possible to store dietary information, along with a list of the ingredients in each dish. This also explores whether ontologies are viable options for storing knowledge in real world systems. It details the development, testing and evaluation of an ontology-based system for a restaurant that has two user interfaces. One interface is for a customer to query the menu, and the other is for the owner of a restaurant to manage the menu within the system. The system is evaluated with a user study after development is complete. The findings of this report find that ontologies are perfectly capable of storing information in a real world application, and have the capability to store extensive information about the menu for a restaurant.
